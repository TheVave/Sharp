### FOLDERS ###

This directory is the main directory for the solution. All of the code for SharpPhysics is inside the **SharpPhysics** directory and 
the code for the current tester app is **SharpInterface**. __Test_Content__ is a directory that contains testing content for MonoGame, the current renderer.
__NOTE: MonoGame is not made by me, it is a open source game engine, find them <a src="https://monogame.net/">here</a>

### FILES ###

The **buildnumber** file contains the build of SharpPhysics that the commit is from.
The file **displayUpdate.bat** is a file that was originally used to update display.exe in the build output directory of the old PhysicsTester project.
The **stackBuilds.bat** is a file to put a whole lot (all) of the builds in a directory.
