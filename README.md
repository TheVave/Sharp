SharpPhysics is a (somewhat small) (2d) physics library that is set up with OpenGL and GLFW bindings.
The renderer is not fully set up, but I'm working on it.

## BUILD NOTES ##
To build, just use VS with .net 8, but also make sure to copy over the files that end with .glsl to the output directory, as they're used in the program.
