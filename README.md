### SUMMARY ###
---------------------------------------------------------

SharpPhysics is a (somewhat small) (2d) physics library that is set up with Silk.net with OpenGL.

### BUILDING ###
---------------------------------------------------------

To build, do all the normal things to build, and make sure to copy over all .glsl files to [output directory]\Shaders,
and also copy over glfw.dll to the output directory.

### PLATFORM SUPPORT ###
---------------------------------------------------------

Currently SharpPhysics only runs on Windows, because the glfw.dll file isn't compatible with other Operating Systems.
#### UPDATE ####
Soon it may be compatible with MacOS and Linux.

### RECENT UPDATES ###

Camera is done. 
I'm going to start work on collision. 
See you 'round.
