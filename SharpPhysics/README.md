[ProgramSaving](SharpPhysics/ProgramSaving) This folder contains very few things and does not have any functionality.
[Renderer](SharpPhysics/Renderer) This folder is no longer in use, but was going to be used to communicate with FastPixelWriter and be the main 2d renderer.
[Simulation](SharpPhysics/Simulation) This folder contained things that can apply to 2d and the old 3d code.
